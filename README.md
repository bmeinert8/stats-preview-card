## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to create responsive layouts. I also improved my skills in using CSS custom properties for better maintainability.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my CSS Grid skills and explore more advanced CSS animations, as well as learning Javascript and its frameworks and libraries, ultimately comming back to these projects and rebuilding them with my new knowledge.
